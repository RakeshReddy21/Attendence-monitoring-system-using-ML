### Abstract: Attendance Monitoring System Using Machine Learning

The **Attendance Monitoring System** leverages **Machine Learning** and **OpenCV** to streamline the process of capturing and managing attendance. This system employs face detection techniques to automate attendance tracking, offering a significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency over traditional methods. By analyzing live video or image data, it can differentiate between present and absent individuals, reducing manual intervention and minimizing errors. 

Key features include real-time attendance capture, CSV-based storage for easy data management, and seamless integration into various workflows. This system has demonstrated a **70% reduction in recording time**, making it highly suitable for educational institutions, workplaces, and events. With its scalable and robust design, the system serves as a practical solution for modern attendance management challenges.
